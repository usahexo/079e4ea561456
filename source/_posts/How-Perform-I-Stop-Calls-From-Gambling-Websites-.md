#  How Perform I Stop Calls From Gambling Websites? 

If you have been getting calls from gambling websites, there are a few things you can do to stop them. First, you can register your phone number with the National Do Not Call Registry. This will stop most telemarketing calls, but it may not stop all of them. You can also ask your phone company to block calls from certain numbers. If the calls are coming from an unfamiliar number, you can try searching online for the number to see if it is associated with any gambling websites. If you find that the number is associated with a gambling website, you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission.

It can be difficult to stop gambling websites from calling your phone, but there are a few things you can do to help prevent the calls. One of the easiest ways is to install a call blocker app on your smartphone. There are several call blocker apps available for free in the App Store and Google Play Store.

Another way to stop the calls is to add the gambling websites’ numbers to your contact list and then block them using your phone’s settings. To add a number to your contacts, open the Phone app and tap on the “Contacts” tab at the bottom. Then, tap on the “Add Contact” button in the top right corner.

Enter the number of the gambling website and then tap on “Create”. Once you have added all of the numbers, you can block them by opening your phone’s Settings app and tapping on “Phone”.
