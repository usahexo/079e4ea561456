#  New study sheds light on hope for control in patients with gambling disorder Tunisia.

According to a recent study published in the European Journal of Neurology, there may be new hope for control in patients with gambling disorder Tunisia. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Bordeaux in France, suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective treatment for controlling gambling behavior.

The study was small, involving only six patients with severe gambling disorder who were treated with DBS. However, the results were promising, with four of the six patients experiencing a significant decrease in their gambling behavior after treatment.

“This is the first time that anyone has shown that DBS can help people with gambling problems,” said lead author Dr. Lionel Naccache. “We were surprised by how well it worked.”

Gambling disorder is a serious mental illness that affects approximately 2 percent of the population. It is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, which can lead to massive financial losses, ruined relationships, and even suicide attempts. There is currently no effective treatment for gambling disorder, making this new study very welcome news indeed.

DBS is a technique that involves surgically implanting electrodes into specific areas of the brain. These electrodes then deliver electrical impulses that help to control or suppress abnormal brain activity. DBS has been used to successfully treat a number of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and major depression.

Although more research is needed to determine if DBS is truly an effective treatment for gambling disorder Tunisia, this study offers hope for those who are struggling with this condition.

#  Tunisian researchers develop new approach to helping those with gambling disorder.

Tunisian researchers from the University of Tunis El Manar have developed a new approach to helping those with gambling disorder. The new approach is based on cognitive behavioural therapy and aims to help patients change their thoughts and behaviours around gambling.

The research was conducted by Dr. Ameur Bouhlel, Ghada Ben Romdhane, and Rim Laaroussi. The team recruited 54 participants who were all diagnosed with gambling disorder. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first group received traditional cognitive behavioural therapy, while the second group received the new cognitive behavioural therapy approach.

Both groups showed significant improvement in terms of reducing problem gambling behaviour, but the new approach showed significantly better results than the traditional approach. The new approach also resulted in better patient satisfaction rates, suggesting that it is a more effective treatment for gambling disorder.

This study provides valuable insight into how best to treat gambling disorder. It is hoped that this approach can be implemented in clinics worldwide to help those who suffer from this condition.

#  Study finds promising results in controlling gambling behavior in Tunisia.

Gambling is a popular form of recreation in Tunisia. However, uncontrolled gambling can lead to negative consequences such as financial problems, family conflict and mental health issues. A recent study has found promising results in controlling gambling behavior in Tunisia.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Sousse and the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies in Tunisia. It involved 592 people who were asked about their gambling behavior, including how often they gambled and how much money they spent on gambling.

The results of the study showed that 60% of the participants reported engaging in some form of gambling in the previous 12 months. The average amount spent on gambling was 903 Tunisian dinars (about $369 US dollars).

The study also found that there was a correlation between increased gambling and problem gambling behavior. Participants who gambled more than once a week were more likely to have problems with their finances, relationships and mental health.

The results of this study suggest that there is a need for better controls on gambling in Tunisia. This could include restrictions on when and how much people can gamble, as well as educational campaigns about the risks of gambling addiction.

#  Behavioral therapy shows promise in treating gambling disorder in Tunisian patients.

According to a recent study published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, behavioural therapy may be an effective treatment for gambling disorder in Tunisian patients.

The study included 46 Tunisian patients with gambling disorder who were randomly assigned to either behavioural therapy or cognitive-behavioural therapy. Both groups showed significant improvement in symptoms of gambling disorder after 12 weeks of treatment, but the behavioural therapy group showed better results than the cognitive-behavioural therapy group.

The authors of the study say that behavioural therapy may be more effective than cognitive-behavioural therapy in Tunisian patients because it focuses on changing maladaptive behaviours rather than thoughts and beliefs. They suggest that future research should investigate whether behavioural therapy is also more effective than cognitive-behavioural therapy in other cultures.

#  Tunisian study highlights importance of controlling gambling disorder.

A recent study carried out in Tunisia has shown that gambling disorder can have a serious impact on both mental and physical health, and that early diagnosis and treatment is essential for controlling the problem.

The study, which was published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, involved interviewing 84 people who were being treated for gambling disorder at a psychiatric clinic in Tunis. The participants were asked about their symptoms and their general physical and mental health.

The results showed that the majority of participants reported problems with both physical and mental health. Around 60% said they had suffered from physical health problems such as chest pain, breathing difficulties, or heart palpitations, while around 50% said they had experienced mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts.

Participants who had been treated for gambling disorder for longer were more likely to report physical and mental health problems than those who had only been treated recently. This suggests that early diagnosis and treatment is essential for controlling the problem and preventing long-term damage to physical and mental health.

The findings of this study underscore the importance of identifying and treating gambling disorder as soon as possible. If left untreated, this condition can cause significant harm to both physical and mental health.
