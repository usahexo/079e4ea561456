# What is the Medieval Mania? 

The Medieval Mania is a term used to describe a period of time in European history where there was a significant increase in artistic and cultural production. This era, which took place from the 11th to the 14th centuries, has been called the “golden age” of medieval art. 

During the Medieval Mania, there was a renewed interest in classical antiquity which led to new styles of art and architecture. Gothic art, with its intricate designs and tall spires, became popular during this time. The Romanesque style also experienced a resurgence, with its use of heavy stone arches and round windows. 

There was a great deal of creativity and innovation during the Medieval Mania. Composers such as Hildegard von Bingen and Guillaume de Machaut wrote some of the earliest surviving music from the era. Writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Dante Alighieri created some of the most well-known works of English and Italian literature. And builders such as Michelozzo created beautiful cathedrals and palaces that still stand today. 

Despite its name, the Medieval Mania was not just about art and culture. It was also a time of great progress in science and technology. For example, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press during this time, which allowed for the widespread distribution of books. 

Overall, the Medieval Mania was a period of great creativity and progress that left a lasting legacy on European history.
