#  How To Reset IGT Slot Machine - No Need For A Special Tool

Slot machines are popular in casinos and amusement arcades around the world. Slot machine operation generally involves insertion of a specially designed token called a “coin” or “token” into the machine, which activates a series of reels that simulate the spinning of traditional slot machine wheels. If the player matches three symbols on one reel, they typically win a prize. There are many different types of slot machines, but they all rely on stopping particular combinations of symbols on the rotating reels in order to determine whether the player has won or not.

IGT is one of the largest slot machine manufacturers in the world, and their products can be found in casinos and arcades across the globe. IGT slot machines are popular because they offer players an opportunity to win large prizes, but what happens when things go wrong and you need to reset the machine? In this article we will look at how to reset IGT slot machines without using a special tool.

The first thing you need to do is find out what type of slot machine you are dealing with. There are two main types: electromechanical and digital.
