# How to Play Blackjack in the New Zealand Casino 888 Latvia

Blackjack, an incredibly popular casino game, can be enjoyed in the 888 Latvia casino. Before playing blackjack in any casino, it is important to understand the basic rules of the game. This guide will teach you how to play blackjack like a pro in the New Zealand casino 888 Latvia!

To begin, each player is dealt two cards face up. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. In order to win, your card total must be higher than that of the dealer, but not exceed 21. If both you and the dealer have the same card total (e.g. 20), this is known as a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses money.

If you want to hit (take another card), touch the table gently with your finger and the dealer will give you another card face up. You can keep hitting until you either go over 21 or decide to stand (stop taking cards). Similarly, if you want to double your bet (and therefore receive just one more card), simply place another chip next to your original bet. Finally, if you would like to split your hand (i.e. play two separate hands instead of one), put an additional bet equal to your original bet next to the first chip(s). You can then draw cards for each hand independently, but each hand will need its own turn at drawing cards - so if one hand gets a good card, the other hand cannot benefit from that until its own turn comes around again!

The basic techniques for playing blackjack are as follows:

- Hit when your cards total between 12 and 16 points; stay when your total is 17 or above
- Double down when you have a total of 10 or 11 points; hit on any other total
- Split 2 Aces or 2 8s; otherwise hit if you are dealt two consecutive cards of the same rank
Now that you know how to play blackjack in 888 Latvia casino, it’s time to put your skills into practice!

# How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro in Casino 888 Latvia

If you're looking to up your blackjack game, Casino 888 Latvia is the place to be. In this article, we'll give you some tips on how to play like a pro and maximize your profits.

First and foremost, it's important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. Here are the basics:

- The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by collecting cards that total 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.

- Players are dealt two cards each and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.

- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each, an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points and other cards are worth their face value.

- To start the game, players must place a bet. They can then hit (draw more cards), stand (end their turn), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), split (split a hand of two identical cards into two separate hands) or surrender (give up half their bet and end the hand).

Now that you know the basics, let's move on to some tips for playing like a pro.

1. Know when to hit and when to stand. Always remember that your aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your first two cards add up to 18 or less, you should hit; if they add up to 19 or more, you should stand. However, there are exceptions to this rule - for example, if the dealer is showing a low card (2 through 6), you may want to hit even if your cards add up to 18 or more. Conversely, if the dealer is showing a high card (10 or Ace), you may want to stand even if your cards total less than 18. As a general rule of thumb, always make sure you have at least 12 points when considering whether or not to hit - this gives you a good chance of winning without risking going bust.

2. Use basic strategy charts. A basic strategy chart tells you what action to take in every possible scenario during blackjack gameplay. By memorizing one of these charts and using it as a guide during play, you'll greatly improve your chances of winning money at casino blackjack tables. You can find free basic strategy charts online by doing a quick search engine query - just be sure to use a reputable source!

3. Double down when it's advantageous. When you double down in blackjack, you're essentially doubling your bet and receiving one more card from the dealer in exchange. This can be a very profitable move under certain circumstances - for example, if you have 11 points with the dealer showing a low card (2 through 6), doubling down will almost certainly give you a better hand than hitting would. Make sure you read up on when it's advantageous to double down so that you can make the most of this move when it's available to you at the table..
