#  Dual Deck Pitch Blackjack Hits the Tables at the Limoges Casino!

The Limoges Casino has just unveiled a brand new attraction - Dual Deck Pitch Blackjack! The game pits two players against each other in a battle of skill and wits, as they try to make the best hand possible from the cards dealt to them.

Dual Deck Pitch Blackjack is played with two standard decks of 52 cards each, which are shuffled together and dealt face down to the players. A player may either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with the current total), just like regular blackjack. However, the twist is that both players can see each others' cards! This makes for some nail-biting decisions, as one wrong move could give your opponent an edge.

The aim of the game is to score 21 points exactly, or as close as possible without going over. A player who busts (goes over 21) automatically loses, regardless of their opponent's score. The first player to reach or exceed 21 points wins the hand. If both players have 21 points at the end of a hand, it is considered a push and no money is won or lost.

Dual Deck Pitch Blackjack is proving to be a popular attraction at the Limoges Casino, with players enjoying the challenge of outsmarting their opponents. So if you're looking for an edge in your next blackjack game, be sure to check out Dual Deck Pitch Blackjack!
