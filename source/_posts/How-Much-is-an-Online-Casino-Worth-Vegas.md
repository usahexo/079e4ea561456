#  How Much is an Online Casino Worth Vegas?

When it comes to casino gambling, there’s simply no place like Vegas. The glitz and glamour of the Strip is hard to beat, and with all those casinos clustered together, it’s easy to find a game you love.

But what about online casinos? How do they compare to the real thing? And more importantly, how much is an online casino worth Vegas?

Well, the answer to that question may surprise you. Online casinos are actually worth quite a bit less than their physical counterparts. In fact, on average, an online casino is worth only around 50% of its Vegas counterpart.

There are a few reasons for this disparity. First, online casinos don’t have the same overhead costs as their physical counterparts. There’s no need for a large property or expensive staff, so operators can pass on those savings to players in the form of lowerminimums and tighter margins.

Second, online casinos are at a disadvantage when it comes to marketing. Physical casinos can offer things like complimentary rooms and meals, as well as luxurious surroundings that simply can’t be replicated online. This gives them an edge when it comes to attracting players.

Lastly, there’s the trust factor. Many people simply don’t trust online casinos enough to gamble with them, which results in smaller player pools and less revenue overall.

So if you’re looking for a truly Sin City gambling experience, stick with the real thing. But if you want some gaming action without breaking the bank, an online casino is a great option.

#  Worth up to $13.5 Billion, Gambling Industry is Booming

The gambling industry is huge and is only getting bigger. In 2017, it was worth up to $13.5 billion and is estimated to reach $21.5 billion by 2021. So what is driving this growth?

There are a few reasons for the booming gambling industry. The first reason is that it is becoming increasingly easier to gamble. With the advent of online casinos and poker rooms, as well as the availability of betting apps, people can now gamble from anywhere in the world. This has made gambling more accessible and convenient, which has enticed more people to try it out.

Another reason for the growth of the gambling industry is that there have been many technological advancements in recent years that have made gambling more exciting and fun. For example, online casinos can now offer live casino games with real dealers, which gives players a more realistic gambling experience. Additionally, virtual reality technology is being used more and more in online casinos, allowing players to immerse themselves in a virtual casino environment and play their favourite games in complete realism.

The third reason for the growth of the gambling industry is that there have been major regulatory changes in recent years that have made it easier for companies to operate in certain jurisdictions. For example, in 2013 the US government overturned a ban on online poker, which has allowed online poker companies to operate freely in the United States. As a result, the US online poker market has grown significantly over the past few years.

Overall, there are a number of factors contributing to the growth of the global gambling industry. The easy access to gambling, coupled with new and exciting technologies and favourable regulatory changes, is attracting more people than ever before to give gambling a try. And as long as this trend continues, the gambling industry will continue to grow at an impressive rate.

#  Online Casino Worth $1.7 Billion in Nevada

The gambling industry is one that is continuing to grow, with more and more people looking to online options to get their fix. In Nevada, this is particularly apparent, as the industry there is now worth an estimated $1.7 billion.

This number comes from a new report released by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’ Center for Gaming Research. It shows that the state’s casinos brought in $11.5 billion in revenue in 2017, a 7.5 percent increase from the year before.

Much of this growth can be attributed to the expansion of online gambling in the state. This includes offerings like poker and casino games, which have become increasingly popular among players in Nevada.

In addition, there has been a rise in tourism spending in the state, with visitors spending an average of $1,174 per trip last year. This was up 5 percent from 2016 and helped contribute to the overall growth of the gambling industry.

It will be interesting to see how things continue to develop over the next few years, as Nevada looks to maintain its position as a top gambling destination.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Worth More than $2.5 Billion

The gambling and entertainment hub of Atlantic City is now worth more than $2.5 billion, according to a new report.

The market evaluation, conducted by real estate services company CBRE, shows the current worth of the city's casinos and other tourism-related properties. The total figure is up from the $2.3 billion valuation from last year.

"The resurgence in Atlantic City's casino industry is having a positive impact on the value of adjacent property," said John Boyd, principal of the Boyd Company, which specializes in site selection for businesses. "This increase in value is a direct result of increased visitation to Atlantic City and the corresponding increase in revenue being generated by the casinos."

The 12 casinos in Atlantic City saw a collective revenue bump of nearly 5 percent in 2016, with total gaming winnings reaching $2.48 billion. That growth is expected to continue this year, with another 3 percent uptick projected.

In addition to casinos, the CBRE report also evaluated other tourism-related properties in Atlantic City such as hotel rooms, restaurants and retail establishments. The total value of those properties comes in at just over $3 billion.
