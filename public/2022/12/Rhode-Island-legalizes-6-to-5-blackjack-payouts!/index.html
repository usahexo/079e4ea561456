This new regulation will go into effect on January 1, 2019, and is sure to stir up mixed reactions from both players and casino operators alike.</p>
<p>Some proponents of the change argue that it will make the game more exciting and attract players who might not have otherwise given it a try. Others believe that it essentially amounts to a “hidden tax” on casinos, as they will now be required to payout a higher percentage of winning hands.</p>
<p>What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-casinos-switch-to-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts"><a href="#Rhode-Island-casinos-switch-to-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island casinos switch to 6 to 5 blackjack payouts!"></a>Rhode Island casinos switch to 6 to 5 blackjack payouts!</h1><p>In what is being seen by industry insiders as a clear sign of desperation, Rhode Island casino executives announced today that they are changing the payouts for blackjack from 3 to 2, to 6 to 5.</p>
<p>This move is expected to have a devastating effect on the state’s economy, as people from all over the region come to take advantage of the better odds. “This is going to kill tourism in Rhode Island,” said one local business owner. “People aren’t going to want to come here and play blackjack when they can go somewhere else and get paid more money for doing the same thing.”</p>
<p>Casino executives insist that this change is necessary in order to remain competitive, but many observers believe that it is only a matter of time before they are forced to close their doors. “This is a last-ditch effort by the casinos to try and stay afloat,” said one analyst. “They’re in trouble and they know it.”</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-pays-6-to-5-in-Rhode-Island"><a href="#Blackjack-pays-6-to-5-in-Rhode-Island" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack pays 6 to 5 in Rhode Island!"></a>Blackjack pays 6 to 5 in Rhode Island!</h1><p>There are some casinos that offer blackjack with a 6 to 5 payout, and Rhode Island is one of them. If you’re looking to play blackjack and want to maximize your chances of winning, then head to a casino in Rhode Island that offers this payout.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a few things you should know about playing blackjack in this way. For starters, the rules may be a bit different than what you’re used to. In particular, the dealer may be more likely to hit on soft 17 (a hand including an ace totaled as 6 points), which can impact your strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, the minimum bet at most casinos in Rhode Island will be higher when compared to other casinos around the country. So if you’re on a tight budget, you may want to avoid playing blackjack at these establishments.</p>
<p>Overall, though, if you’re looking for an opportunity to earn a little more on your blackjack bets, then Rhode Island is definitely worth checking out. Just be sure to brush up on the local rules before sitting down at the table!</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-now-has-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts"><a href="#Rhode-Island-now-has-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island now has 6 to 5 blackjack payouts!"></a>Rhode Island now has 6 to 5 blackjack payouts!</h1><p>In the great state of Rhode Island, blackjack players can rejoice! Starting July 1st, all blackjack tables in the state will offer 6 to 5 payouts on blackjack, as opposed to the traditional 3 to 2 payout. This change is sure to bring more players to the tables, and increase profits for the casinos.</p>
<p>The transition to 6 to 5 payouts has been in the works for a while now. The Rhode Island Gaming Commission has been studying the issue since last year, and finally came to a decision in late June. The new payout scheme is expected to bring an additional $7 million annually to Rhode Island’s casinos.</p>
<p>So why are casinos making this change? It seems like they’re losing money with every hand! Actually, it’s quite the opposite; casinos are expecting this change to increase their profits by about 15%. The reason for this is that players are more likely to bet more when they have a better chance of winning. With a 6 to 5 payout, players are more likely to hit blackjack and walk away with some extra cash.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and this change is sure to draw even more players to Rhode Island’s gaming tables. If you’re looking for some excitement and big payouts, be sure to head over to Rhode Island and try your luck at blackjack!</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-latest-casino-to-offer-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts"><a href="#Rhode-Island-latest-casino-to-offer-6-to-5-blackjack-payouts" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island latest casino to offer 6 to 5 blackjack payouts"></a>Rhode Island latest casino to offer 6 to 5 blackjack payouts</h1><p>The Newport Grand Casino, located in Newport, Rhode Island, has announced that it will offer players the chance to earn payouts of 6 to 5 on blackjack hands starting on July 1st. The casino joins the ranks of several other casinos around the country who have made the switch to 6 to 5 blackjack payouts in an effort to attract customers and improve their bottom lines.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with the game, blackjack is a casino table game where players are initially dealt two cards face up and are looking to achieve a total closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a King, Queen or Jack (all considered “face cards”) are each worth 10 points. If the sum of a player’s first two cards is 21 or less, that player wins immediately (a “blackjack”).</p>
<p>Under the old payout system, blackjack hands that ended in a tie were generally paid out at 3 to 2 odds by most casinos. This meant that a player who wagered $10 on a hand would receive $15 back if they won. With the new 6 to 5 payout system, however, such a player would now only receive $12 back–a decrease of 20%. This change has caused some consternation among players in states where these new payouts have been implemented, as many feel it constitutes nothing less than a reduction in their expected winnings.</p>
<p>Casino representatives contend that the move is necessary in order for them to remain competitive in an ever-changing industry landscape. With more and more states legalizing both land-based and online gambling, casinos are feeling pressure to find new ways to entice customers and keep them coming back for more. It should be noted that even under the new payout system, blackjack remains one of the best bets available at any casino; it’s just that players now have less of an edge when compared with games such as roulette or craps.</p>
<p>If you plan on visiting Newport Grand Casino in the near future, be sure to take advantage of its new 6 to 5 blackjack payouts!</p>
