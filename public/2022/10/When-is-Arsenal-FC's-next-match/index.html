<p>The match will be played at Turf Moor in Burnley. It will be the first match of the Premier League for both teams.</p>
<p>Arsenal is coming off a disappointing season where they finished in 5th place and failed to qualify for Champions League. They will be looking to start the new season strong and get back into the Champions League.</p>
<p>Burnley had a decent season last year, finishing in 7th place. They will also be looking to continue their good form this season and improve on their position from last year.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-Arsenal-FC’s-biggest-rivals"><a href="#Who-are-Arsenal-FC’s-biggest-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Who are Arsenal FC’s biggest rivals?"></a>Who are Arsenal FC’s biggest rivals?</h1><p>Arsenal FC have a long and storied history in English football. Throughout their time in the top division, they have amassed a host of rivals. Some are newer to the scene, while others have been with Arsenal since they first set foot in the top flight. But who are Arsenal’s biggest rivals?</p>
<p>Manchester United</p>
<p>One of Arsenal’s fiercest rivals is Manchester United. The two clubs have a long and bitter history, dating back to when they first met in 1894. The rivalry was ramped up when Sir Alex Ferguson became manager of Manchester United in 1986, and he regularly sought to get one over on Arsene Wenger and Arsenal. The rivalry has continued under new management, with both clubs competing for silverware on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Liverpool</p>
<p>Arsenal’s rivalry with Liverpool is also one of the most intense in English football. The clubs share a number of rivalries, including the North London derby and the Merseyside derby. But their rivalry is arguably most intense when they meet in the Champions League or FA Cup. The two teams have met in some classic matches over the years, with neither side ever willing to give an inch.</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur</p>
<p>Arsenal’s rivalry with Tottenham Hotspur is another fiery one. The two sides are regular fixtures against each other in the Premier League and cup competitions, with neither side ever willing to give an inch. The two sets of fans also enjoy winding each other up, creating a hostile atmosphere whenever they meet.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-League-titles-have-Arsenal-FC-won"><a href="#How-many-League-titles-have-Arsenal-FC-won" class="headerlink" title="How many League titles have Arsenal FC won?"></a>How many League titles have Arsenal FC won?</h1><p>Arsenal Football Club is an English professional football club based in Holloway, north London. They play in the Premier League and are one of the most successful clubs in England with 13 First Division and Premier League titles.</p>
<p>The club was founded in 1886 as Plumstead CommonFC, and played their first match in September 1888. They joined the Southern League Second Division in 1892, and won promotion to the First Division at the first attempt. However, they were relegated after one season and spent the next three seasons in the Second Division before winning promotion again in 1897. They finished as runners-up in 1904 but did not win their first league title until 1933.</p>
<p>The 1930s saw Arsenal win five titles, including two doubles. The second of these doubles was completed by winning the FA Cup in 1930 and 1931. After finishing as runners-up twice during the 1940s, they won back-to-back league titles in 1953 and 1954. Two more doubles followed – in 1970 and 1971 – with a third FA Cup win sandwiched between them. The cup drought that had started with their last success in 1992 ended with victory over Hull City at Wembley Stadium in 2014.</p>
<p>So far, Arsenal have won 13 First Division&#x2F;Premier League titles, 12 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 1 Community Shield and 1 European Cup Winners’ Cup.</p>

He has been in the role since 1996 and is the longest-serving manager in Premier League history.</p>
