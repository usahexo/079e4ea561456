<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the legislation into law, authorizing sports betting at casinos and racetracks across the state. The new law allows people 21 years or older to bet on individual games or tournaments, as well as parlay bets on multiple contests.</p>
<p>Supporters of the new law say that it will bring much-needed revenue to Illinois, which is facing a budget crisis. According to estimates from the gaming industry, sports betting could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and create other social ills. They also contend that sports betting should be regulated by the federal government, not left up to states.</p>
<p>The legality of sports betting has been a matter of debate in the United States for many years. The 1992 federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) prohibited states from sanctioning sports betting, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>However, in May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down PASPA, ruling that it violated states’ rights to make their own decisions about gambling laws. This opened the door for states to legalize sports betting if they chose to do so.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Delaware. Others are considering similar proposals, including Massachusetts and Michigan.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of legalized sports betting has led to a heated debate about its pros and cons. Supporters tout its potential economic benefits, while opponents warn of its potential social costs.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that legalization will lead to more widespread illegal gambling activity, as well as corruption in professional and amateur sports. Others argue that such concerns are overblown and that states can regulate sports betting effectively to minimize such risks.</p>
<p>  So far, there is little evidence that legalized sports betting has had any negative impact in states where it is already legal. In fact, it appears that most people are using it responsibly and enjoying it without any major problems.</p>
<p>  As more states move to legalize sports betting, this debate is sure to intensify. It will be important for lawmakers and regulators to carefully consider all of the pros and cons before making a decision about whether or not to allow it</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-betting-in-wake-of-SCOTUS-decision"><a href="#Illinois-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-betting-in-wake-of-SCOTUS-decision" class="headerlink" title="Illinois becomes first state to legalize sports betting in wake of SCOTUS decision"></a>Illinois becomes first state to legalize sports betting in wake of SCOTUS decision</h1><p>The Illinois General Assembly became the first state legislature in the US to legalize sports betting on Monday, barely a week after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>The Illinois bill permits sports betting at casinos, race tracks, and online. The legislation does not allow bets on college sporting events, but does allow for wagers on professional games.</p>
<p>Sponsored by State Representative Mike Zalewski, the bill passed the Illinois House of Representatives by a vote of 109-6. It now moves to the desk of Governor Bruce Rauner, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for the state of Illinois and for fans of sports all across our country,” said Representative Zalewski in a statement. “I want to thank my colleagues in the House for their support and I look forward to working with Governor Rauner to get this legislation signed into law as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island and New Jersey are also in the process of legalizing sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-joins-8-other-states-in-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Illinois-joins-8-other-states-in-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Illinois joins 8 other states in legalizing sports betting"></a>Illinois joins 8 other states in legalizing sports betting</h1><p>On Tuesday, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed HB 690 into law, legalizing sports betting in the state. This makes Illinois the ninth state in the US to legalize some form of sports gambling, after New Jersey led the way in May 2018.</p>
<p>Under the new law, people over 21 years of age will be able to place bets on sporting events through licensed casinos or online platforms. The minimum legal age for placing a bet is 18 years old, but only for bets placed at a casino or racetrack. Bets placed online will have to be made by someone 21 years or older.</p>
<p>It is still not clear exactly when sports betting will become available in Illinois, as regulations still need to be put in place. However, it is expected that betting on both professional and collegiate sporting events will soon be available in the state.</p>
<p>The passage of HB 690 comes on the heels of a Supreme Court decision last year which struck down a federal ban on sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Proponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it will generate much-needed tax revenue for states, as well as create jobs in the gaming industry. They also point to studies which suggest that legal sports betting does not increase rates of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to increased rates of addiction and crime, and that it undermines the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<p>So far, evidence suggests that legalization has had a positive effect on states which have adopted it. In New Jersey, for example, tax revenue from legal sports betting has exceeded expectations, and there has been no significant increase in crime or addiction rates.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how Illinois will fare after legalizing sports betting, but with nine other states already taking advantage of this growing trend, it seems likely that this move will be good for the state’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-legislators-pass-bill-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Illinois-legislators-pass-bill-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Illinois legislators pass bill legalizing sports betting"></a>Illinois legislators pass bill legalizing sports betting</h1><p>Illinois is on the verge of becoming the fifth state in the US to legalize sports betting, after its legislators passed a bill on Wednesday that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer bets on sporting events. The bill still needs approval from Governor J.B. Pritzker, who has said he supports legalization, but it’s expected to be signed into law soon.</p>
<p>Once it goes into effect, Illinois residents will be able to place wagers at brick-and-mortar locations as well as through online and mobile apps. The state will take a share of the profits (25% for casinos and a sliding scale for racetracks), which is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<p>So far, four states have legalized sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a ban on the activity in 2018: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is also close to legalizing it, and several other states are considering following suit.</p>
<p>Experts say that legalization could help boost tourism and create jobs in Illinois, as well as generate much-needed funding for state programs. And while there are some concerns that gambling addiction could increase, most experts believe that it can be effectively regulated.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that the majority of Americans support legalization of sports betting. A recent poll by Gallup found that 55% of Americans favor it, while only 33% oppose it. This is likely due to the fact that legalized sports betting offers significant benefits to states and their residents.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how quickly other states follow Illinois’ lead in legalizing sports betting – and how much revenue this new form of gambling brings in nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-becomes-latest-state-to-legalize-sports-betting"><a href="#Illinois-becomes-latest-state-to-legalize-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Illinois becomes latest state to legalize sports betting"></a>Illinois becomes latest state to legalize sports betting</h1><p>After a long and arduous journey, the Illinois state legislature has finally passed a bill legalizing sports betting in the state. The landmark legislation was signed into law by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday, making Illinois the latest of several states to legalize sports wagering in recent months.</p>
<p>The new law will allow casinos and horse tracks in Illinois to offer sports betting, with the first bets set to be placed later this year. Bettors will be able to place wagers on a variety of professional and amateur sporting events, including NFL, NBA, MLB, and NCAA games.</p>
<p>While there had been some opposition to the bill in the state legislature, it ultimately passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Governor Pritzker praised the legislature for its work in passing the bill and noted that it would provide much-needed revenue for the state budget.</p>
<p>“This is a historic day for Illinois as we legalize sports betting and bring new economic development opportunities to our state,” said Governor Pritzker. “I want to thank the General Assembly for their hard work on this important issue, and I look forward to working with them to make sure that Illinois gets the most out of this new industry.”</p>
<p> Sports betting is already legal in a number of states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. The market for sports betting is estimated to be worth $150 billion annually, so there is considerable potential for states that legalize it.</p>
