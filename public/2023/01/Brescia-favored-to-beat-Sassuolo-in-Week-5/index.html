<p>Brescia, who are coming off a strong win against Parma last time out, are expected to beat Sassuolo this weekend.</p>
<p>Sassuolo have been struggling in recent weeks, winning just one game in their last four matches. They will need to improve if they want to take anything away from this game.</p>
<p>Brescia are unbeaten at home so far this season and will be looking to make that five wins from five games. Their attacking trio of Andrea Petagna, Alfredo Donnarumma and Andraz Sporar have been in fine form so far this season and could cause problems for Sassuolo’s defense.</p>
<p>Sassuolo will be without key player Jeremie Boga who is suspended, while Brescia could welcome back Bruno Fernandes after he served his suspension last time out.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting game with Brescia looking likely to come out on top.</p>
<h1 id="Napoli-jumps-ahead-of-Juventus-in-betting-odds"><a href="#Napoli-jumps-ahead-of-Juventus-in-betting-odds" class="headerlink" title="Napoli jumps ahead of Juventus in betting odds"></a>Napoli jumps ahead of Juventus in betting odds</h1><p>One of the most intense rivalries in European football is between Napoli and Juventus. The clubs are located in neighboring cities in Italy, and the competition between them is always fierce.</p>
<p>This season, Napoli has been having an excellent campaign and is currently in first place in the Serie A table. Juventus, on the other hand, has been struggling and is currently in third place.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a big shift in betting odds for the two clubs. Napoli is now the favorite to win the Serie A title, with Juventus seen as a much longer shot.</p>
<p>Napoli has always been a great club, but this season they seem to have something special. Maurizio Sarri has done an excellent job of getting the most out of his players, and they are currently playing some of the best football in Europe.</p>
<p>Juventus, on the other hand, seem to be suffering from a bit of a hangover after their Champions League final defeat last season. They have not looked as strong this season and have been susceptible to some big losses.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out over the rest of the season. Napoli certainly looks like the team to beat at the moment, but Juventus always has a chance to turn things around.</p>
<h1 id="Roma-slips-in-sports-betting-following-disappointing-loss-to-Spal"><a href="#Roma-slips-in-sports-betting-following-disappointing-loss-to-Spal" class="headerlink" title="Roma slips in sports betting following disappointing loss to Spal"></a>Roma slips in sports betting following disappointing loss to Spal</h1><p>Roma is coming off a demoralizing loss to Spal, and this has raised some concerns among sports betting enthusiasts. The odds for Roma to win the Scudetto have shifted from 7&#x2F;4 to 4&#x2F;1, and this has prompted many people to wonder if there is something wrong with the team.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be addressed is the fact that Roma was missing several key players, including Kevin Strootman, Diego Perotti, and Alessandro Florenzi. This certainly had an impact on the team’s performance, and it will be interesting to see how they fare once everyone is back in action.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs to be considered is Roma’s recent history of collapses. Last season, they squandered a large lead and ended up finishing second behind Juventus. This year, they have already lost three games after winning their first seven matches. So there are definitely some red flags that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>But it would be premature to write off Roma just yet. They still have plenty of time to make up ground in the standings, and they are certainly capable of mounting a comeback. In fact, their match against Juventus later this month could very well prove decisive in terms of the title race.</p>
<p>So while things may not look good for Roma right now, there is still plenty of potential for them to turn things around. Sports betting fans should keep an eye on their progress in the coming weeks and months, and see how they stack up against the competition.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-still-the-favorite-to-win-the-Serie-A-title"><a href="#Inter-Milan-still-the-favorite-to-win-the-Serie-A-title" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan still the favorite to win the Serie A title"></a>Inter Milan still the favorite to win the Serie A title</h1><p>Inter Milan has been playing some of the best football in Europe as of late, and they are still the favorites to win the Serie A title. The team is led by Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic, who have both been scoring goals at a high rate.</p>
<p>Since the departure of Frank de Boer, Inter Milan has gone on a five-match winning streak, putting them in first place in the Serie A standings. They have also scored 16 goals and conceded just four in that span.</p>
<p>Their opponents this weekend will be Fiorentina, who are currently in seventh place in the table. This matchup should be a good one, as both teams like to play an attacking style of football. However, Inter Milan should be able to come out victorious and continue their winning streak.</p>
<p>Inter’s next few fixtures look very favourable for them, as they will be facing clubs such as Chievo Verona, Crotone and Cagliari. With Icardi and Perisic leading the way, Inter should have no problem picking up all three points in those matches.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Inter Milan remain the favourites to win the Serie A title this season. Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic have been in top form recently, and with Luciano Spalletti leading them, Inter should be able to make a serious push for the championship.</p>
<h1 id="Brescia-remains-the-banker-for-Serie-A-sports-betting"><a href="#Brescia-remains-the-banker-for-Serie-A-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Brescia remains the banker for Serie A sports betting"></a>Brescia remains the banker for Serie A sports betting</h1><p>The football fans in Italy are eagerly awaiting the start of the season, which kicks off on Saturday. The US sports betting market is gearing up for some serious action on the top Italian league, Serie A.</p>
<p>Brescia remains the banker for Serie A sports betting. The online sportsbooks have installed the modest club from Lombardy as favorites to win the league, with odds of +1100. Juventus, who have won the last eight titles, are second favorites at +450.</p>
<p>Brescia finished runner-up in 1955&#x2F;56 and have never won Serie A, but they come into this season with a new manager, Eugenio Corini, and some impressive new signings, including Leonardo Morosini from Atalanta and Mario Balotelli from Marseille.</p>
<p>Juventus were dealt a major blow over the summer when their superstar player Cristiano Ronaldo completed a world-record transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid. This could pave the way for Brescia or one of the other challengers to upset the odds and take home the title.</p>
<p>Napoli are third favourites at +700, followed by Inter Milan (+800), AC Milan (+1400) and Roma (+1600). Lazio (who finished just behind Brescia in last season’s table) are at +2000 along with Torino, Fiorentina and Sampdoria.</p>
